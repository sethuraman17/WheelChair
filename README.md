# WheelChair
I have done lane detection using image processing and here i have compare with lane detected through 4 methods
1. edge detection
2. colour detection
3. RANSAC algorithm
4. (i) thesholding, (ii) img warping, (iii) pixel summation, (iv) averaging, (v) display

   and i got good result in 4th method because we can also find the curve value that how much angle it is turning for a curve so by just adding moder module
   we can able to do a wheel chair which is automatically move by following the lane.
